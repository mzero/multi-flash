== A ==


[x] only seek files after a few seconds of flash updates stop
    [-] and force a flush  -- already done in the msc callback
    [] clear error/status on rescan
    [] error if no boot
        - since that is currently required

[] Eject button
    - is this even possible? perhaps just sync button

[] progress bar
    [] write & verified
    - okay to have one bar for both

[] reset line is funky?

[] reset target after flashing?

== B ===


[] LED Interface
    - flutter while writing & verifying
    - on full when done
    - slow blink if error?

[] CPX Interface
    - Speaker Interface
        - tick while writing & verifying
        - beep on done
        - buzz on error
    - NeoPixels as progress bar
    - NeoPixels as error

[] formats flash as FAT (compatible with CircuitPython we hope)
	[] writes all the needed stuff to keep mac happy
	        f_mkdir(&vfs_fat->fatfs, "/.fseventsd");
	        make_empty_file(&vfs_fat->fatfs, "/.metadata_never_index");
	        make_empty_file(&vfs_fat->fatfs, "/.Trashes");
	        make_empty_file(&vfs_fat->fatfs, "/.fseventsd/no_log");
    [] volume name
    [] format flash if button down on boot



== FUTURE ===

[] connector ground for sensing connection (don't forget to pause)

[] Adafruilt_DAP
    [] use of perror_exit is flawed
        - sometimes used when first part of message is after Serial.print() calls
        - expects to exit app (or rather hang app) - so no good for app to continue
    [] enable programming w/o full chip erase
        - would need program block to use the erase row command (as sort of coded in comments)
    [] lock fuses
        - use temporary unlock commands?
        - set them based on size of things burned? just boot?
        - is boot always 8k?
            8k for M0
            16k for M4
    [] GCC 4.4 warning:
        Adafruit_DAP_library/Adafruit_DAP.h:295:40:
        note: offset of packed bit-field 'Adafruit_DAP_SAMx5::<unnamed union>::<unnamed struct>::BOD33_Level' has changed in GCC 4.4

[] handle boot binaries that are the "wrong" size for the platform
    - how to know what the right size is?
